# Introduction revision

## Why is the introduction important?

If we want our readers to keep reading, we need to prove to them that it‚Äôs worth their time.

The introduction tells our readers what they can expect from the document. When reviewers read it, they should know what they will find out and be able to picture how the ideas will be developed.

If you confuse or bore your readers at the beginning, it might be hard to recover!
