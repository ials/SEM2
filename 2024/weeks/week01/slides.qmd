# A refresher on science & research 


## Knowledge

Knowledge refers to a theoretical and/or practical understanding of a subject. It can be implicit  or explicit; it can be more or less formal or systematic. In philosophy, the study of knowledge is called *epistemology*.  Knowledge acquisition involves complex cognitive processes: perception, communication, and reasoning.

## Science and technology (Sc&T)

Science uses *empirical investigation* to pursue many of the deepest questions pondered by scholars. Engineering uses *empirical knowledge* to design and develop technology: products, processes, machines, and structures to solve the major challenges that face society. Together, Sc&T are essential to advance  the human condition.

## Research

Research is a process of systematic inquiry that entails collection of data; documentation of critical information; and analysis and interpretation of that data/information, in accordance with suitable methodologies set by specific professional fields and academic disciplines.

## What is a researcher? (1)

A researcher is someone who conducts systematic investigations and studies of materials and sources to establish facts, reach new conclusions, and develop theories.

## Research methodology

It is a structured and scientific approach used to collect, analyze, and interpret quantitative or qualitative data to answer research questions or test hypotheses. A research methodology is like a plan for carrying out research. 

## Quantitative research methodology

It focuses on measuring and testing numerical data. This approach is good for reaching a large number of people in a short amount of time. This type of research helps in testing the causal relationships between variables, making predictions, and generalizing results to wider populations.

## Qualitative research methodology

It examines the opinions, behaviors, and experiences of people. It collects and analyzes words and textual data. This research methodology requires fewer participants but is still more time consuming because the time spent per participant is quite large. This method is used in exploratory research.

https://paperpal.com/blog/academic-writing-guides

## Mixed-method research methodology 

It uses both quantitative and qualitative  methodologies in the same study. This method allows to validate  findings, verify if the results observed using both methods are complementary, and explain unexpected results obtained from one method by using the other method.

# Writing a research article

## Primacy of the research question

A good research paper addresses a specific research question.
The research question‚Äîor study objective or main research
hypothesis‚Äîis the central organizing principle of the paper.
*Whatever relates to the research question belongs in the
paper; the rest doesn‚Äôt*.

## Structure of the research paper

- Introduction
- Methods
- Results
- Discussion

## Introduction

- Problem statement
- Knowledge gaps
- Research question

## Data & Methods

- Study context & setting
- Study design (framework, variables, sampling)
- Population (or study area)
- Workflow (data collection, data analysis)

## Results

- Description of workflow outputs 
- Present key findings

## Discussion

- Answer the research question
- Discuss findings from a broader perspective
- Analyze strengths and limitations
- Offer perspectives
