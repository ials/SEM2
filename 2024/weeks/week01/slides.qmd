# A refresher on science & research 


## Knowledge

Knowledge refers to a theoretical and/or practical understanding of a subject. It can be implicit  or explicit; it can be more or less formal or systematic. In philosophy, the study of knowledge is called epistemology.  Knowledge acquisition involves complex cognitive processes: perception, communication, and reasoning.

## Science and technology

Science uses empirical investigation to pursue many of the deepest questions pondered by scholars throughout history. Engineering uses empirical knowledge to design and develop technology: products, processes, machines, and structures to solve the major challenges that face society. Together, science and technology are essential in the positive advancement and evolution of the human condition.

## Research

Research is a process of systematic inquiry that entails collection of data; documentation of critical information; and analysis and interpretation of that data/information, in accordance with suitable methodologies set by specific professional fields and academic disciplines.

## What is a researcher? (1)

A researcher is someone who conducts systematic investigations and studies of materials and sources to establish facts, reach new conclusions, and develop theories.

## Research methodology

It is a structured and scientific approach used to collect, analyze, and interpret quantitative or qualitative data to answer research questions or test hypotheses. A research methodology is like a plan for carrying out research and keeping on track by limiting the scope of the research. 

## Quantitative research methodology

It focuses on measuring and testing numerical data. This approach is good for reaching a large number of people in a short amount of time. This type of research helps in testing the causal relationships between variables, making predictions, and generalizing results to wider populations.

## Qualitative research methodology

It examines the opinions, behaviors, and experiences of people. It collects and analyzes words and textual data. This research methodology requires fewer participants but is still more time consuming because the time spent per participant is quite large. This method is used in exploratory research where the research problem being investigated is not clearly defined.

## Mixed-method research methodology 

It uses the characteristics of both quantitative and qualitative research methodologies in the same study. This method allows researchers to validate their findings, verify if the results observed using both methods are complementary, and explain any unexpected results obtained from one method by using the other method.

# Flipped classroom

## Reading, doing and writing

A flipped classroom is structured around the idea that lecture or direct instruction is not the best use of class time. Instead students encounter information before class, freeing class time for activities that involve higher order thinking
