# A refresher on science & research 


## [Knowledge](https://www.librarianshipstudies.com/2017/11/knowledge.html)

Knowledge refers to a *theoretical and/or practical understanding of a subject*. 

It can be implicit  or explicit; it can be more or less formal or systematic. 

The study of knowledge is called *epistemology*.  

Knowledge acquisition involves complex cognitive processes: perception, communication, and reasoning.



## [Science and technology (Sc&T)](https://corecurriculum.nd.edu/our-core-curriculum/ways-of-knowing/science-and-technology/)

Science uses *empirical investigation* to pursue many of the deepest questions pondered by scholars. 

Engineering uses *empirical knowledge* to design and develop technology: products, processes, machines, and structures to solve the major challenges that face society. 

Together, Sc&T are essential to advance  the human condition.



## [Research](https://www.hampshire.edu/what-research)

Research is a process of *systematic inquiry* that entails collection of data; documentation of critical information; and analysis and interpretation of that data/information.

Research is conducted in accordance with suitable methodologies set by specific professional fields and academic disciplines.


## [What is a researcher? (1)](https://typeset.io/questions/what-is-a-researcher-3hwiofeb8w)

A researcher is someone who conducts systematic investigations and studies of materials and sources to establish facts, test hypotheses, reach new conclusions, and develop theories.

## [What is a researcher? (2)](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/blog/what-do-we-mean-facts)

- A fact is an indisputable observation of a natural or social phenomenon. 

- A hypothesis is an idea that we can test with further observations. 

- A theory is an explanation for what we observe, drawing together many facts and hypotheses.

## Research methodology

It is a *structured and scientific approach* used to collect, analyze, and interpret quantitative or qualitative data to answer research questions or test hypotheses. 

A research methodology is like a plan for carrying out research. 

## [Quantitative research methodology](https://paperpal.com/blog/academic-writing-guides)

It focuses on *measuring and testing numerical data*. 

This approach is good for reaching a large number of people in a short amount of time. 

It helps in testing the causal relationships between variables, making predictions, and generalizing results to wider populations.


## [Qualitative research methodology](https://paperpal.com/blog/academic-writing-guides)

It examines opinions, behaviors, and experiences of people. 

It collects and analyzes words and textual data. 

It usually is time consuming due the time spent per participant. This method is used in exploratory research.



## [Mixed-method research methodology](
https://paperpal.com/blog/academic-writing-guides) 

It uses both quantitative and qualitative  methodologies in the same study. 

This method allows to validate  findings, verify if results observed using both methods are complementary, and explain unexpected outcomes.

# Writing a research article

## Primacy of the research question

A good research paper addresses a specific research question.

The research question‚Äîor study objective or research
hypothesis‚Äîis the central organizing principle of the paper.

*Whatever relates to the research question belongs in the
paper; the rest doesn‚Äôt*.

## Structure of the research paper

- Introduction
- Methods
- Results
- Discussion

## Introduction

- Problem statement
- Knowledge gaps
- Research question

## Data & Methods

- Study context & setting
- Study design (framework, variables, sampling)
- Population (or study area)
- Workflow (data collection, data analysis)

## Results

- Description of workflow outputs 
- Present key findings

## Discussion

- Answer the research question
- Discuss findings from a broader perspective
- Analyze strengths and limitations
- Offer perspectives
